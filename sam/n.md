Sure, I can help you create the necessary models for your game logic engine based on the information you provided. Here are the models and their attributes:\n\n1. Game Model:\n* GameName (string)\n* StageCount (int)\n* MaxPlayers (int)\n* CharacterList (list of Character models)\n2. Player Model:\n* PlayerName (string)\n* PlayerType (string)\n3. Character Model:\n* CharacterName (string)\n* CharacterType (string)\n4. Ability Model:\n* AbilityName (string)\n* AbilityDescription (string)\n5. Clause Model:\n* ClauseName (string)\n* ClauseDescription (string)\n6. Action Model:\n* ActionName (string)\n* ActionDescription (string)\n7. Stage Model:\n* StageName (string)\n* StageDescription (string)\n8. GameLogicModel:\n* GameName (string)\n* PlayerList (list of Player models)\n* CharacterList (list of Character models)\n* AbilityList (list of Ability models)\n* ClauseList (list of Clause models)\n* ActionList (list of Action models)\n* StageList (list of Stage models)\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the GameLogicModel in Dart:\n```php\nclass GameLogicModel {\n  String gameName;\n  int stageCount;\n  int maxPlayers;\n  List<Character> characterList;\n  List<Ability> abilityList;\n  List<Clause> clauseList;\n  List<Action> actionList;\n  List<Stage> stageList;\n\n  GameLogicModel({\n    this.gameName,\n    this.stageCount,\n    this.maxPlayers,\n    this.characterList,\n    this.abilityList,\n    this.clauseList,\n    this.actionList,\n    this.stageList,\n  });\n}\n```\nYou can create instances of these models and use them to represent your game's logic and rules.\n### Human: i want you to Create a Game Logic Engine Consists of these modeles : Game - Player
